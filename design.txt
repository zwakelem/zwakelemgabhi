DATA
 - because of the sql script, I changed all the nodes with a single quotation at the end, to an asterisk
 for example, A' is A* and B' is B* etc.

REST SERVICE:
- do not have an update method, for both Edge and Node, it is easier to delete and create when objects are this simple.

ALGORITHM:
- I used an existing library, easier than writing my own code. I do not need to test the actual algorithm.

DESIGN DECISIONS
- Graph creator I made a Singleton, it make sense to make only one instance that is also protected by not having a public constructor. If any update should
be done, it should be in this one instance.
- SOAP and REST endpoints share 1 service, no need to repeat for each web service.


WHAT'S MISSING BECAUSE OF TIME CONSTRAINT
- error handling on the frontend
- Test coverage is not at 80%
- Additional
